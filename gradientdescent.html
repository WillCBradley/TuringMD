        <h2 class="idea-subtitle">Gradient Descent</h2>

        <p class="idea-body">The slope of a line is called its gradient.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We can find the gradients of any given point on a graph, no matter its shape.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And by knowing these slopes, we know which way the line/curve is pointing, and hence which direction (left or right) brings us closer to zero.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">If a line is pointing down and to the right, we simply follow it to the right. But if it’s going up and to the right, we might need to trace it back to the left (and so on).</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is the essence of gradient descent.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Our goal here is to minimise inaccuracy of our regression model by bringing the cost function as close as possible to zero.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Consider a graph of the cost function relative to weight or bias.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">We start at any point on the cost function’s graph, and follow the gradient down (hence “descent”) to the lowest point.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">The value of the weight/bias that corresponds to this minimum tells us how to adjust the line that we draw over our datapoints, thus making our linear regression more accurate.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Interesting, right?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">And funnily enough, it has <a href="./neuralnetworks">direct relevance to neurology.</a></p>
