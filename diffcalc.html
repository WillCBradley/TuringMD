        <h2 class="subheading" id="functions">| Functions</h2>
        <p>A function is a rule that matches inputs to outputs.</p>
        <p>For a given function f that takes input x, we expect the output f(&#119909) (read as "f of &#119909").</p>
        <p>But let's use a more tangible example - mean arterial pressure. If we know a patient's systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressure, we calculate their MAP as follows:</p>
        <p>MAP = <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>D + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>S</p>
        <p>This can be rewritten as a function like so:</p>
        <p>f(S, D) = <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>D + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>S</p>
        <p><i>(Note: we can replace "f" with anything; it's just an arbitrary label.)</i></p>
        <p>Intuitively, if we change the inputs (S and D), we change the output (f(S, D)). But sometimes, we want to take a closer look at this relationship.</p>
        <p>And to do that, we need to understand rates.</p> 
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="rates">| Rates</h2>
        <p>A rate is a ratio between two quantities, explaining how they change with respect to one another.</p>
        <p>For instance, if a drug is dosed at 10mg/kg, then for every 1kg increase in weight, we expect a 10mg increase in dose.</p>
        <p>Constant rates (like the one above) produce straight lines:</p>
        <!-- Picture of f(x) = 10x to mirror above relationship -->
        <p>To calculate the <i>gradient</i> of this line, we divide the height change ("rise") of any line segment by the corresponding horizontal change ("run").</p>
        <!-- Add in gradient calculation labels -->
        <p>This is a simple concept, but it will be extremely important later.</p>
        <p>Not least because of this next concept.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="derivatives">| Derivatives</h2>
        <p>Imagine we wanted the gradient of a single point in a function.</p>
        <p>This gives us the <i>instantaneous rate of change</i> at that point, which can be extremely important. After all, a 10-second drop in O<sub>2</sub> sats is very different to a 10-year one.</p>
        <p>But a single point is exactly that: single.</p>
        <p>How do we calculate gradient if we don't have a no rise or run?</p>
        <p>Mathematicians spent a long time trying to figure this out. And thankfully, we can copy their homework.</p>
        <p>Using certain rules, we can find the "first derivative" of any function f(&#119909), written as f'(&#119909) ("f prime of &#119909"). Then, for any input a, f'(a) gives us the single-point gradient at f(&#119909) at &#119909 = a.</p>
        <p>For each term in a function, the rules are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="tight">
            <li>First, a term is constant (i.e. is not multiplied by a variable), remove it</li>
            <li>Next, multiply each remaining term by the exponent of its associated variable value (e.g. if the term is &#119909<sup>2</sup>, multiply by 2)</li>
            <li>Lastly, subtract 1 from the exponent of each variable term (so &#119909<sup>2</sup> becomes &#119909, &#119909 becomes 1, etc).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is easier than it sounds on paper.</p>
        <p>For example, let's find the derivative of f(&#119909) = &#119909<sup>2</sup>+5:</p>
        <p>First we remove, 5, since it's constant, leaving us with &#119909<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>Then, we multiply by the remaining term by 2, since &#119909 is raised to the power of 2. This gives us 2&#119909<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        <p>And finally, we subtract 1 from the exponent of &#119909, giving us 2x<sup>1</sup>, which is the same as 2&#119909.</p>
        <p>So, for f(&#119909) = &#119909<sup>2</sup>+ 5, f'(&#119909) = 2&#119909.</p>
        <p>If this doesn't make sense yet, don't worry.</p>
        <p>As long as you understand that differentiation gives us the instantaneous gradient of a function, feel free to <a href="#integration">skip ahead</a>.</p>
        <p>But if you're still with us, let's keep moving:</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="chainrule">| The Chain Rule</h2>

        <p>Sometimes, functions can contain other functions.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine f(&#119909) = a(b(c(d(&#119909))))</p>
        <p>At first, this looks like a headache to differentiate. But luckily, there's a pretty simple rule:</p>
        <ul class="tight">
            <li>Find the derivative of the first function</li>
            <li>Pass all the following functions as input to this derivative, and note this term down somewhere</li>
            <li>Repeat for the all remaining functions (e.g. for the second "layer", pass the third, fourth, fifth... functions as input to the derivative, and so on)</li>
            <li>Once you have all these terms, multiply them all together (like links in a chain; hence "chain rule")</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, for our example above:</p>
        <p>f'(&#119909) = a'(b(c(d(&#119909)))) x b'(c(d(&#119909))) x c'(d(&#119909)) x d'(&#119909)</p>
        <p>This seems complex, but becomes intuitive with time.</p>
        <p>For now, let's move on to partial derivatives.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="partial">| Partial Derivatives</h2>
        <p>Remember our mean arterial pressure function?</p>
        <p>Notice how it had two variables: systolic and diastolic BP.</p>
        <p>In all our differentiation examples so far, &#119909 has been the only variable. How do we handle multiple at once?</p>
        <p>Put simply: we don't.</p>
        <p>In all past examples, we've been <i>differentiating with respect to &#119909.</i></p>
        <p>This is the same as choosing &#119909 for our "run" value in our gradient calculation, or using "per kilogram bodyweight" when calculating a drug dosage.</p>
        <p>And while we don't always need to use &#119909, we can only choose one variable at a time.</p>
        <p>So, when differentiating with respect to a certain variable in a multivariate equation, we treat the others as constants.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>For our function f(S, D) = <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>D + <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>S, let's find the derivative with respect to S.</p>
        <p>Since D is now constant, so is <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>D, so we remove this term.</p>
        <p>All that's left is to follow the remaining steps, turning <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>S into <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>. So f'(S, D) = <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>.</p>
        <p>Now that we've wrapped our head around this stuff, let's take a look at integration.</p>
        <p><sub>a </sub>∫<sup> b</sup>〖f(x)  dx〗</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="integration">| Integration</h2>
        <p>You can imagine integration as the opposite of differentiation.</p>
