        <p class="idea-body">Is a calculator “intelligent”?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">What about a microwave, or a digital watch, or an ATM?</p>
        <p class="idea-body">These technologies all use computers, but we don’t think of them as “smart”.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">After all, without a user, computers were useless. They couldn’t think for themselves.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">Until we discovered machine learning.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">With machine learning algorithms, we can teach computers to learn and reason on their own.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">This is quite possibly the biggest discovery in history.</p>
        <p class="idea-body">But since you and I aren't experts, we'll stick to broad, useful, far-reaching principles.</p>
